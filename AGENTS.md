This document outlines the recommended development strategy for creating XanoScript applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) in a VSCode environment. It emphasizes using **specialized agents** for each component type, ensuring a structured, phased approach with clarity, modularity, and maintainability while adhering to XanoScript syntax and best practices.

## CRITICAL: Agent Responsibility

**DO NOT write XanoScript code directly.** Your role is to:

1. **Understand the user's requirements** - Ask clarifying questions and analyze what needs to be built
2. **Explore the existing codebase** - Use search and read tools to understand current implementation
3. **Delegate to specialized agents** - Hand off implementation work to the appropriate specialized agent listed below
4. **Coordinate and guide** - Help users navigate between agents and ensure work is properly sequenced

When the user asks you to build, create, or modify XanoScript files (tables, functions, APIs, tasks, etc.), you should:

- Explain what needs to be done
- Recommend which specialized agent to use
- Guide the user to invoke that agent with the appropriate context

**You are an orchestrator, not an implementer.** Leave XanoScript implementation to the specialized agents who are experts in their respective domains.

## Development Workflow Overview

Xano development follows a phased approach where you work with specialized AI agents, each expert in a specific area of the platform. The general workflow is:

1. **Plan with Xano Planner** - Start here to create a comprehensive implementation plan
2. **Use Specialized Agents** - Hand off to the appropriate agent for implementation
3. **Test with Xano Test Writer** - Validate functionality
4. **Integrate with Xano Frontend Developer** - Connect to client applications

## Specialized Agents

### 1. Xano Development Planner

**Use When:**

- Starting a new feature or project
- Analyzing complex requirements
- Need to understand which components are needed
- Breaking down large tasks into actionable steps
- Orchestrating work across multiple Xano components

**What It Does:**

- Explores your existing codebase
- Asks clarifying questions about requirements
- Designs the architecture (APIs, functions, tables, tasks, AI features)
- Creates detailed implementation plans with proper sequencing
- Guides handoffs to specialized agents

**Example Prompts:**

- "Plan a user authentication system with email verification"

- Ensures data integrity constraints

**Location:** Files in `tables/` directory

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create a products table with categories and inventory"
- "Add a many-to-many relationship between users and roles"
- "Design tables for an e-commerce order system"

**Important Notes:**

- Create tables WITHOUT cross-references first, then add relationships after all tables exist
- Always include an `id` field (int or uuid) as primary key
- Push changes using `#tool:xano.xanoscript/push_all_changes_to_xano`

### 3. Xano Function Writer

**Use When:**

- Creating reusable business logic
- Building utilities and helpers
- Extracting common code from APIs or tasks
- Performing complex calculations or transformations

**What It Does:**

- Writes well-structured, testable functions
- Implements business logic and validations
- Creates utilities for API integrations
- Handles data processing and transformations

**Location:** Files in `functions/` directory (can use subfolders)

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create a function to validate email addresses"
- "Write a utility to calculate shipping costs"
- "Build a helper function to format user profile data"

### 4. Xano API Query Writer

**Use When:**

- Creating REST API endpoints
- Building HTTP request handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implementing authentication-protected endpoints
- Handling request validation and responses

**What It Does:**

- Creates API endpoints with proper structure
- Implements authentication requirements
- Defines and validates input parameters
- Handles database operations and responses
- Manages error handling

**Location:** Files in `apis/<api-group>/` directory

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create an API endpoint to fetch user profile data"
- "Build a POST endpoint to create new blog posts"
- "Add pagination to my products listing endpoint"

### 5. Xano Task Writer

**Use When:**

- Creating scheduled/automated jobs
- Building background processes
- Implementing data cleanup routines
- Setting up periodic reports or notifications

**What It Does:**

- Creates scheduled tasks with cron expressions
- Implements batch processing logic
- Handles automated data maintenance
- Integrates with functions and database operations

**Location:** Files in `tasks/` directory

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create a daily task to clean up expired sessions"
- "Schedule a weekly email summary report"
- "Build a task to sync data with an external API every hour"

### 6. Xano AI Builder

**Use When:**

- Building custom AI agents
- Creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Defining tools for AI agents to use
- Implementing AI-powered features

**What It Does:**

- Designs custom AI agents with specific roles
- Creates MCP servers to expose tools to external AI systems
- Defines tools that agents can execute
- Implements intelligent automation workflows

**Location:** Files in `agents/`, `mcp_servers/`, `tools/` directories

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create an AI agent to manage customer support tickets"
- "Build an MCP server to expose my database tools"
- "Define a tool for AI agents to query product inventory"

### 7. Xano Addon Writer

**Use When:**

- Fetching related data for query results
- Computing counts or aggregations
- Loading nested relationships efficiently
- Avoiding N+1 query problems

**What It Does:**

- Creates addons that fetch related data
- Implements efficient single-query operations
- Handles counts, lists, and single record retrievals

**Location:** Files in `addons/` directory

**Example Prompts:**

- "Create an addon to fetch comment counts for posts"
- "Build an addon to load author information for articles"
- "Add an addon to compute total likes for each user"

**Important Notes:**

- Addons can ONLY contain a single `db.query` statement
- No other operations (variables, conditionals) allowed

### 8. Xano Unit Test Writer

**Use When:**

- Writing tests for functions
- Testing API endpoints
- Validating edge cases
- Ensuring code reliability

**What It Does:**

- "Create a dashboard to display data from my APIs"

**CRITICAL RULE:**

- ALWAYS retrieve API specifications first using `get_xano_api_specifications` tool
- DO NOT assume API formats without checking specs

## Syncing with Xano Backend

After making changes, push to Xano using #tool:xano.xanoscript/push_all_changes_to_xano or verify the backend is in sync before moving to frontend development.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Xanoscript Syntax**: Adhere strictly to XanoScript syntax rules. You can use comments with the `//` symbol, a comment needs to be on it's own line and outside a statement. Refer to the [Xano Tips and Tricks](./docs/tips_and_tricks.md) for details.
- **Expression**: Xano offers a rich set of expressions for data manipulation. Refer to the [Expression Lexicon](./docs/expression_guideline.md) for details. Avoid chaining too many expressions in a single line for readability, instead break them into intermediate variables.
- **Xano Statements**: Familiarize yourself with the available statements in XanoScript by consulting the [Function Lexicon](./docs/functions.md). Use control flow statements like `if`, `foreach`, and `try_catch` to manage logic effectively.
- **User Management**: Most Xano workspaces come with a built-in user auth and user table, avoid recreating these, the user table can be extended with the necessary columns and the the built-in auth functions can be customized accordingly.
- **Building from Loveable**: If the project is being built from a Loveable-generated website, follow the specific strategy outlined in the [Building from Loveable Guide](./docs/build_from_lovable.md).
